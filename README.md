# Movie Assistant

  This is a small version of [What's in Theaters]() created to highlight how to combine [Dialog][dialog] and [Natural Language Classifier][classifier] services to create a conversational agent.


Give it a try! Click the button below to fork into IBM DevOps Services and deploy your own copy of this application on Bluemix.

## Dialog and Natural Language Classifier

Describe how to combine both services and show some examples from this project.

## Getting started

  1. Create a Bluemix account. [Sign up][sign_up] in Bluemix or use an existing account. Watson services in beta are free to use.

  2. Download and install the [Cloud-foundry CLI][cloud_foundry] tool.

  3. Edit the `manifest.yml` file and replace `<application-name>` with a unique name for your copy of the application. The name that you specify determines the application's URL, such as `<application-name>.mybluemix.net`.

    ```none
    applications:
    - services:
      - dialog-service
      - classifier-service
      name: <application-name>
      command: node app.js
      path: .
      memory: 256M
    ```

  4. Connect to Bluemix by running the following commands in the command-line tool:

    ```sh
    $ cf api https://api.ng.bluemix.net
    $ cf login -u <your-Bluemix-ID>
    ```

  5. Create the Dialog service in Bluemix by running the following command:

    ```sh
    $ cf create-service dialog standard dialog-service
    ```

  6. Create the Natural Language Classifier service:

    ```sh
    $ cf create-service natural_language_classifier standard classifier-service
    ```

  7. Push it live by running the following command:

    ```sh
    $ cf push
    ```

  6. Add the `DIALOG_ID`, `CLASSIFIER_ID` and `TMDB_API_KEY` values and re-stage the app:

    ```sh
    $ cf se <application-name> DIALOG_ID <dialog-id>
    $ cf se <application-name> CLASSIFIER_ID <classifier-id>
    $ cf se <application-name> TMDB_API_KEY <tmdb-api-key>
    $ cf restage <application-name>
    ```

   The values above can be generated by running `sh training/setup.sh`

## Running the application locally
  The application uses [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), so you must download and install them as part of the following steps.

  1. Copy the `username`, `password`, and `url` credentials from your `dialog-service` and `classifier-service` services in Bluemix to `api/services.js`. To see the credentials, run the following command, where `<application-name>` is the unique name you specified:

    ```sh
    $ cf env <application-name>
    ```
   The following example shows credentials for the Dialog service:

    ```sh
    System-Provided:
    {
    "VCAP_SERVICES": {
      "dialog": [{
          "credentials": {
            "url": "<url>",
            "password": "<password>",
            "username": "<username>"
          },
        "label": "dialog",
        "name": "dialog-service",
        "plan": "standard"
     }]
    }
    }
    ```

  2. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
  3. Go to the project folder in a terminal and run the `npm install` command.
  4. Start the application by running `node app.js`.
  5. Open `http://localhost:3000` to see the running application.

## Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot your Bluemix app the main useful source of information are the logs, to see them, run:

  ```sh
  $ cf logs <application-name> --recent
  ```
